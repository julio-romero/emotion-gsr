# GUI Application for Images, Emotion Peaks, Website using iMotions

## Overview

Welcome to the "GUI Application for Images, Emotion Peaks, Website using iMotions" project! This comprehensive tool combines three separate projects into one powerful GUI application:

1. **Image Emotion Analysis**: Apply iMotions emotion analysis to images.
2. **Video Emotion Peaks**: Apply iMotions emotion analysis to videos and extract emotion peaks.
3. **Website Eye Tracking Heatmaps**: Apply iMotions eye-tracking analysis to websites and generate heatmaps.

This README provides detailed information on how to set up and use each component of the project.
